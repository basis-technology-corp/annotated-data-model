/**
 * A Relationship Mention describes arguments in a sentence and a predicate that connects them.
 * It also includes event-related information (such as the location and time the action represented by the mention
 * took place), an indication of the relationship's salience and modality, as well as metadata such the name of the
 * algorithm that yielded the extraction and the confidence thereof.
 * For example, the sentence "Leila Lopes, Miss Angola 2011, was crowned Miss Universe 2011 in Brazil on September 12th, 2011."
 * can yield a following RelationshipMention (among others):
 * <blockquote><pre>
 *     arg1: [Leila Lopes(Q232501)]
 *     predicate: [be crowned]
 *     arg2: [Miss Universe 2011(Q932457)]
 *     temporals:    [on September 12th]
 *     locatives:   [In Brazil(Q155)]
 *     context:    [assertion]
 *     source:    [rules:2]
 *     confidence:    [0.679]
